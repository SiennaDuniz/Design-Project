<p class="text"> <br> Author: Sienna Duniz <br>  This website gives examples of things to look into before you pick a nice cat to become a part of your family. Too many animals are abandoned by their owners. Doing research before the owner adopts or goes to a breeder can give the owner a chance to see what they are getting themselves into.</p>
